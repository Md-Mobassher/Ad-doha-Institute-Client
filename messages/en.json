      "description": "Bangladesh is a Muslim majority country. Islam came to this country through Arab and non-Arab preachers, scholars, Sufi saints, and businessmen. Although Bangladesh is a Muslim-majority country, most people in this country cannot read the Quran and lack religious knowledge. As a result, instead of developing a good character and religious mindset, they are being led astray. Especially thousands of impoverished and semi-educated Muslims are unknowingly joining various false ideologies and sects. Various reports indicate that more than half a crore (five million) Muslims have converted to other religions. Besides, many Muslims are losing their faith by falling into the clutches of fake Sufi saints. In this situation, Ad-Doha Institute was established on January 10, 2022, with the aim of providing basic Islamic education to Muslims and protecting their faith.",

All the prophets and messengers that Allah Almighty has sent throughout the ages were responsible for delivering the message of Islam to people. Only Da'wah can unlock the locks of worldly and hereafter welfare and success. Only Da'wah can unlock the doors of humanity's conscience and human development and growth. Da'wah means the work of propagating Islam. It is through Da'wah that Islam spreads widely. The Muslim nation expands. In the present day, there is no opportunity to underestimate the importance of delivering the message of Islam to others. Therefore, Ad-Doha Institute is working tirelessly in the Da'wah field to deliver the great message of Islam and the message of world peace to everyone, regardless of race, religion, or color.",

The first revelation that was revealed to the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the Cave of Hira is, ‘Read, in the name of your Lord who created. He created man from a clot of blood.’ -Surah Al-Alaq: 1-2 The purpose of education in Islam is to develop the son of Adam into a human being. Only humans have the ability to know the unknown through education and to use what they know to discover the unknown. The education that gives self-identity, shapes people as honest and good citizens, and helps them to be benevolent, benevolent and devoted to Allah is true education. Education illuminates the human heart, reveals insight, and creates foresight. Reading and studying are one of the means for learning and acquiring knowledge. Therefore, Ad-Doha has organized various training courses online and offline to develop wise scholars and dedicated Da'is Al-Allah for people of all walks of life, including teaching the authentic Quran, as well as contemporary teaching on Da'wah, Sirah, comparative theology, apostate sects, basic IT, contemporary world, psychology, management, and English language education.",

In addition, there will be a good system of children's Maktab, adult education and separate Quran education for women.
