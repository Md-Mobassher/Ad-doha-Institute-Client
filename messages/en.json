      "description": "Bangladesh is a Muslim majority country. Islam came to this country through Arab and non-Arab preachers, scholars, Sufi saints, and businessmen. Although Bangladesh is a Muslim-majority country, most people in this country cannot read the Quran and lack religious knowledge. As a result, instead of developing a good character and religious mindset, they are being led astray. Especially thousands of impoverished and semi-educated Muslims are unknowingly joining various false ideologies and sects. Various reports indicate that more than half a crore (five million) Muslims have converted to other religions. Besides, many Muslims are losing their faith by falling into the clutches of fake Sufi saints. In this situation, Ad-Doha Institute was established on January 10, 2022, with the aim of providing basic Islamic education to Muslims and protecting their faith.",

      "details1": "Knowledge means education. And books are the vehicle of education. Therefore, as the writing, publishing and marketing of books increases, the kingdom of light will also increase. For this, books should be read individually and collectively. Nowadays, due to the excessive buzz on social media, we do not understand anything about books outside of textbooks. Allah Almighty says in the Holy Quran, ‘Read in the name of your Lord, who created. Who taught by the pen. He taught man that which he did not know.’ (Surah Al-Alaq, verses-1,4,5)...",
      "details2": "To gain systematic and complete knowledge on various subjects and to gain complete mental peace, it is definitely necessary to read books. In this era of fitnah, practicing religion online makes one's faith doubtful. Strengthening faith and maintaining one's faith with one's own conscience and intellect in the search for truth is possible only through reading books. For that purpose, Ad-Doha Institute has collected the best books written in Bengali and English and enriched the Syed Abul Hasan Ali Nadvi E-Library. Which is open to all readers.",
