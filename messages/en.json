      "description": "Bangladesh is a Muslim majority country. Islam came to this country through Arab and non-Arab preachers, scholars, Sufi saints, and businessmen. Although Bangladesh is a Muslim-majority country, most people in this country cannot read the Quran and lack religious knowledge. As a result, instead of developing a good character and religious mindset, they are being led astray. Especially thousands of impoverished and semi-educated Muslims are unknowingly joining various false ideologies and sects. Various reports indicate that more than half a crore (five million) Muslims have converted to other religions. Besides, many Muslims are losing their faith by falling into the clutches of fake Sufi saints. In this situation, Ad-Doha Institute was established on January 10, 2022, with the aim of providing basic Islamic education to Muslims and protecting their faith.",
